# Gendog
A tool for YAML developers to generate Godog boilerplate API tests for your http an 
OpenAPI 3 specification. The use of this tool is intended to be paired with 
[open-api-codegen/open-api-codegen](https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/?tab=readme-ov-file), but can be used for any Go project.

This provides a good starting point for developers to write more thorough tests for their 
APIs. This has the added benefit of giving Github Copilot more context to generate better 
tests.

_\[Developers\] will do anything to avoid the responsibility of writing tests.
It's me, I'm \[developers\]._

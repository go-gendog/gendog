# Gendog
A tool for YAML developers to generate Godog boilerplate API tests for your http server from an OpenAPI 3 specification.
The use of this tool is intended to be paired with [open-api-codegen/open-api-codegen](https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/?tab=readme-ov-file),
but can be used for any Go project.
